# mojangles*s*

### Description
mojangles*s* is a thinner version of default minecraft mojangles font, that was inspired by font of [Faithless](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/faithless) resource pack still only using its own textures.

### Note
This is a fork of [Iskatel-chegoto/mojangless](https://github.com/Iskatel-chegoto/mojangless). Since original pack was archived because of problems it had, this one was created in order to fix these bugs.
